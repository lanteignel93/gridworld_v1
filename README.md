# Gridworld

This code is an example of computing the value function of different states and compute the optimized path and the value of each state once optimized. 

## Motivation

Build a personal repository of codes and get more familiar with Reinforcement Learning! 

## Code Style

The majority of the code and functions definition is inside the "env.py" file and the display is inside the jupyter notebook file "gridworld.ipynb".
